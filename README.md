# Donka Runtime

Part of [Donka](https://github.com/youmssi/donka). Fork of [gorules/agent-public](https://github.com/gorules/agent-public) (MIT); see [DONKA.md](DONKA.md) for what Donka changes.

Donka Runtime is an open-source, standalone microservice that acts as a high-performance Rules Engine over REST, without requiring a UI. It is designed to pull Releases from Object Storage, automatically re-load them at runtime when changes occur, and evaluate decision models efficiently. This ensures that your rules are always up-to-date and accessible with minimal configuration.

## Environment Variables

### AWS

In case your deployment supports IAM, most of the environment variables below are __optional__.

```bash
PROVIDER__TYPE=S3
PROVIDER__BUCKET=bucket
PROVIDER__REGION=us-east-1 # Optional in case of IAM
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<aws-access-key-id> # Optional in case of IAM
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<aws-secret-access-key> # Optional in case of IAM
```

### Azure

```bash
PROVIDER__TYPE=AzureStorage
PROVIDER__CONNECTION_STRING=<connection-string>
PROVIDER__CONTAINER=<container-name>
```

### Google Cloud

```bash
PROVIDER__TYPE=GCS
PROVIDER__BUCKET=<bucket-name>
PROVIDER__BASE64_CONTENTS=<base64-credential-contents>
```

### FileSystem
```bash
PROVIDER__TYPE=Filesystem
```

### FileSystem Zip
For FileSystem type, all project zips should be in ./data folder.
You can build your own image bundled with rules by doing docker build from our image and adding layer that adds ./data folder
```bash
PROVIDER__TYPE=Zip
```

### MinIO
```bash
PROVIDER__TYPE=S3
PROVIDER__REGION=us-east-1
PROVIDER__BUCKET=bucket
PROVIDER__FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true
PROVIDER__ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000
PROVIDER__PREFIX=folder/
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
```
## Rules OpenAPI

`GET /api/rules/{project}` returns an OpenAPI 3 document describing the
deployed release's evaluable rules — one `POST /evaluate/{path}` operation per
graph and policy, tagged by kind.

Request and response schemas come from the rule itself when it declares them on
its input/output nodes. Anything undeclared is derived by analysing the release
as a single workspace: property references become a nested JSON Schema, and the
return types of function nodes are resolved by type-checking their TypeScript.

The document is built on the first request for a project and reused until the
release changes, so only that first request pays for the analysis.

### Type resolution

Function-node types are resolved by [tsgo](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go),
the TypeScript compiler compiled to WebAssembly and run under wasmtime. It is
precompiled at build time (`build.rs`) and embedded in the binary, so startup
deserializes an artifact rather than compiling one.

Running the compiler in a wasm sandbox is what makes it safe to type-check
untrusted rule content in-process: a guest that panics, traps, runs away or
exhausts memory is contained by wasmtime and surfaces as an unresolved type,
never as a crashed agent. Every failure degrades to publishing the declared
schema instead of the derived one.

```bash
TSGO__ENABLED=true         # set false to skip type resolution entirely
TSGO__MEMORY_BYTES=2147483648
TSGO__TIMEOUT=30000        # milliseconds
TSGO__CACHE_CAPACITY=4096  # resolved function types held per process
```

### Build caching

Precompiling the module costs ~26 CPU-seconds. Cargo caches it locally, so only
a change to `build.rs` itself rebuilds it — but CI and Docker start cold. Point
`TSGO_CWASM_CACHE` at a directory to keep the artifact across builds:

```bash
TSGO_CWASM_CACHE=.tsgo-cache cargo build --release
```

`build.rs` revalidates whatever it finds there, checking both that the artifact
came from the same tsgo revision and target and that it still loads. A stale or
corrupt entry is rebuilt rather than used, so the cache cannot ship a module
that fails at runtime.

CI restores this directory with `actions/cache`, and the Dockerfile keeps
dependencies and the module in a stage that only the manifests and `build.rs`
invalidate.

### Building offline

`build.rs` fetches the tsgo wasm module from the `tsgo-wasm` crate's GitHub
release and verifies its checksum. For air-gapped builds, point it at a local
copy instead:

```bash
TSGO_WASM_FILE=/path/to/tsgo.wasm.zst cargo build --release
```
